## Further description
I've downloaded image of pizza for a main screen to not depend it on an internet access.

Code is written in MVC design pattern as I think it's easy to maintain in a such small project.
I've took care about Single Principle Responsibility and DRY rules. I've made my best on writing short and concise methods.

Application was tested on Android Emulator with API 28.
